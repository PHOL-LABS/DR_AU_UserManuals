    \item Each dashboard carries a model code such as \texttt{GART-AR} (red illumination) or \texttt{GART-AG} (green illumination).
    \item Export batches can include additional markings applied by the importing organisation.
    \item The \DRAudi{} dashboard is not sealed; no tamper seals are fitted at the factory.
