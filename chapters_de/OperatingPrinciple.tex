\chapter{Operating Principle} \label{ch:operating-principle}

The \DRAudi{} dashboard reuses the original Audi housing, vehicle connectors, and either the factory mechanical speedometer cable or an electronic speed sensor supplied with the kit.
The electronics are mounted on a fiberglass PCB populated with discrete components driven by an ATmega~2560 microcontroller.
Seven-segment indicators are controlled by MAX~7219 and STLED316 driver ICs that manage the anode and cathode matrices of the LED displays.

The faceplate integrates the LED indication block, and the module is powered directly from the vehicle harness without a standby supply; no leakage current is present when the ignition is off.
The dashboard tolerates input voltages from 9~V to 24~V~DC and reads the vehicle sensors through the wiring described in \autoref{ch:description}.

Both the Bluetooth and miniUIOD-equipped variants share the same display layout and MFA pages, ensuring that installation and day-to-day operation remain consistent regardless of the configuration interface.
