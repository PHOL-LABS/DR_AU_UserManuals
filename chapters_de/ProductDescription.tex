\chapter{Description and operation of the product}\label{ch:description}

\section{Purpose}
The \DRAudi{} digital dashboard replaces the original Audi instrument cluster while extending its functionality.
It provides fully electronic indications for vehicle speed, engine speed, coolant status, fuel level, multifunction computer (MFA) calculations, and warning lamps.
All variants ship with LED-based displays, a tachometer scale in every configuration, and either a Bluetooth or miniUIOD Wi-Fi controller for configuration and diagnostics.

\section{Model identification}
Each dashboard is marked with the package code listed in \autoref{tab:model-range}.
Both variants are assembled units with a remote electronic speed sensor harness and differ only by the colour of the front panel illumination.

\section{Connector pin-outs}
\subsection{Main 10-pin connector}
The 10-pin plug groups the negative returns for the indicator lamps and sensor leads.
All positive feeds originate from the companion 12-pin connector.

    hlines,
    row{1} = {font=\bfseries}

2 & Voltage stabiliser output/input (normally unused). \\
3 & Ground (KL~31). \\

\end{tblr}}

\subsection{Main 12-pin connector}
The second connector supplies the positive feeds and sensor inputs required by the dashboard.

\section{Steering-column switch harness}
The auxiliary harness for the steering-column switch provides six conductors:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item MFA mode selection.
    \item MFA memory block selection.
    \item MFA reset.
    \item Ambient temperature sensor (optional).
    \item Oil temperature sensor (optional).
    \item Vehicle ground.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Alternative Audi wiring variant}
Some Audi vehicles use a second connector mapping.
When encountered, repin the vehicle harness to match the standard layout described above.
The factory configuration typically follows the tables below.

\subsection{Repinning procedure}
Perform the conversion step by step:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extract the terminals from the vehicle connectors using a small screwdriver or terminal tool.
    \item Confirm that pin~4 on both the 10-pin and 12-pin plugs is bonded to chassis ground.
    \item Move the chosen ground wire from pin~4 to pin~3 of the 10-pin plug.
    \item Relocate the wire from pin~9 of the 12-pin plug to pin~1 of the same connector.
    \item Connect both vehicle connectors to the dashboard, switch on the ignition, and verify that the panel powers up before proceeding.
    \item Bridge pin~1 of the 10-pin connector to pin~2 of the same connector.
    \item Connect pin~5 of the 10-pin connector to pin~7 of the 12-pin connector (high beam) and verify the indicator.
    \item Route pin~6 of the 10-pin connector to pin~8 of the 10-pin connector.
    \item Move pin~8 of the 10-pin connector to pin~3 of the 12-pin connector; confirm that the turn indicators operate. Use pin~7 if the indicators remain inactive.
    \item Connect pin~9 of the 10-pin connector to pin~5 of the same connector (coolant temperature sensor).
    \item Leave the oxygen-sensor warning lamp (10-pin pin~10) disconnected unless the optional internal connector is used.
    \item Seatbelt and parking-brake warning lamps (12-pin pins~1 and~2) are available on the internal auxiliary connector; connection is optional.
    \item Jumper pin~3 of the 12-pin connector to pin~4 of the same connector.
    \item Tie pin~5 of the 12-pin connector to pin~10 of the 10-pin connector (alternator lamp).
    \item Connect pin~6 of the 12-pin connector to pin~8 of the 12-pin connector (fuel-level sender).
    \item Bridge pin~10 of the 12-pin connector to pin~9 of the same connector.
    \item Leave pin~12 of the 12-pin connector in place.
    \item Label any unused wires and secure them out of the way.
\end{enumerate}
