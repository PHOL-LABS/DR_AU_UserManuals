\chapter{Package}\label{ch:package}

Each \DRAudi{} delivery set contains the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The assembled dashboard module.
    \item A USBasp programmer with the internal harness pre-installed.
    \item A speed-sensor harness (cable-drive adapter or electronic sensor lead depending on the selected kit).
\end{itemize}

For transport, wrap the components in bubble wrap and place them in a rigid cardboard box.
Alternative packaging is acceptable provided it protects the dashboard during transport and storage.
